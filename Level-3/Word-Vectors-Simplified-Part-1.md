# 3.1. What is a Word Vector? | Word Vectors Simplified 📚🎥

Before diving into the intricacies of Large Language Models, it's crucial to understand the building blocks: Word Vectors. Imagine language as a multi-dimensional space; each word takes up a specific point within that space. That's what word vectors do; they represent text in numerical form to make it comprehensible for LLMs.

In the accompanying video, Anup Surendran lays down the foundation for understanding LLMs by answering key questions:

- What do LLMs stand for?
- What exactly are Word Vectors?
