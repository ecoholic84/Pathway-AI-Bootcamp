# Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) | LLM Architecture and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) 🚀📚

Welcome to the fascinating world of LLM Architecture and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, commonly known as RAG. In this module, we're laying the groundwork for an in-depth exploration of specialized techniques to improve pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for particular use cases. Let's start by understanding what RAG is and why it's such a crucial component in the LLM ecosystem.

## 5.2. What is Retrieval Augmented Generation 🌐🔍

You may have noticed that Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are powerful, but they have their limits. For instance, ChatGPT's training data only goes up to a certain point, missing out on real-time updates. What if you need information that is more recent or specific to your organization? Enter RAG.

**RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is an AI framework that elevates the performance of LLMs. It enables these models to fetch and incorporate information from external data sources, ensuring the generated text is both current and verifiable.**

In simpler terms, RAG empowers LLMs to integrate real-time, reliable data from external sources directly into their generated output.
