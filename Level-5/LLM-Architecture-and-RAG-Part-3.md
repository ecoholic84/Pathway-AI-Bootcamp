# 5.5. How In-Context Learning Works | LLM Architecture and RAG 🧠📚

In this video, you'll be introduced to the concept of in-context learning through prompts. Anup explains how this form of learning is scalable, particularly when dealing with vast amounts of data. 

This becomes especially relevant when we recall our earlier discussions on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Understanding in-context learning amplifies the efficacy of technologies like RAG in Large Language Models.

# 5.6. High-level Breakdown of LLM Architecture for In-Context Learning | LLM Architecture and RAG 🏗️🔍

In this brief video, Anup provides a high-level breakdown of how in-context learning operates within an LLM. He'll guide you through the journey of a prompt as it interacts with a vector database or index, undergoes similarity search, feeds context, and eventually results in a coherent LLM output.

Understanding this architecture is essential for mastering the interaction between prompts and LLMs, a crucial skill for anyone looking to effectively deploy these models in a variety of settings.

Happy Learning! 🚀📚
