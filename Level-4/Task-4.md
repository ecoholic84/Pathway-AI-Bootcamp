# **Task-4 : Prompt Engineering Excerciseüßë‚Äçüíª‚úíÔ∏è**

Below is an interesting story for you. The objective of this exercise is to explore the capabilities and limitations of prompt engineering in the context of the mystery story set in the eSports arena. By focusing on critical aspects like plot extension, few-shot prompting, and model limitations, you will assess how well you can steer the narrative or extract specific insights.

**Subtask 1: Plot Extension**

Design a prompt to generate a continuation of the mystery story that uncovers another layer of the hacking plot. Perhaps Val√©rie finds out there's a mole in her organization, or maybe Sophie encounters another similar case. Craft a prompt that nudges the story into revealing this new dimension. Evaluate how seamlessly the new narrative fits with the original story.

**Subtask 2: Few-Shot Prompting for Character Analysis**

Utilize a few-shot prompt that instructs ChatGPT to analyze the main characters' emotional states at crucial points in the story. For instance, ask the model to perform sentiment analysis on Val√©rie when she discovers the hacking, and Sophie when she finally solves the case. Note the efficacy of few-shot prompting in eliciting nuanced character analysis.

**Subtask 3: Limitation Recognition due to Outdated Data**

Pose a question about the use of AI and machine learning algorithms in contemporary eSports as depicted in the story, asking for the latest advancements as of 2023. Evaluate ChatGPT's response for potential inaccuracies or outdated information given its last training data is from January 2022. Discuss how this limitation affects the believability of the plot and the technological aspects described in the story.

For each subtask, provide the prompt you used, summarize the response, and give a thorough analysis of how well ChatGPT performed in terms of context, plot coherency, and technological accuracy.

**The Story**

In Lyon's bustling technology district, Val√©rie Leroux was a sorceress of software, a conjurer of code. She had created an analytics program that could break down and analyze real-time strategy for the hyper-competitive game "WarScape Online." Yet, a dark cloud hovered over her digital utopia; someone had infiltrated the sacred realms of her software, sowing discord in its algorithms and threatening to upheave the imminent World Championship.

Val√©rie knew she needed specialized help. That's where Detective Sophie Martin came into the picture‚Äîa school friend turned cybersecurity sleuth, who could trace digital footprints like a bloodhound. Sophie's interest piqued immediately; this was no ordinary hack. The integrity of eSports, a burgeoning industry with more at stake than just pixels and points, hung in the balance.

Sophie arrived at Val√©rie's whimsical office, where tech-gadgets met old-world elegance. "If I understand correctly," Sophie said, half-amused, "your software is essentially the Professor McGonagall of eSports‚Äîstern but invaluable?"

"Very much so," Val√©rie responded. "Except someone has confounded McGonagall into giving rather questionable advice."

The World Championship transformed the local stadium into a cathedral of digital warfare. Fans donned vibrant costumes, clutching merchandise like talismans. Val√©rie and Sophie occupied a discreet corner, scrutinizing the spectators, players, and support staff. One person caught their attention‚ÄîJean-Pierre, a competitor in the analytics sector. He was glued to his phone, a sentinel of secrets, scheming in silence.

As the matches unfolded, Val√©rie's software hiccuped, whispering faulty strategies into the ears of players. Sophie and Val√©rie exchanged worried glances; their nemesis had struck again.

In a secluded chamber, Sophie leaned in, "We're hunting a phantom, someone who knows how to erase their traces. What can we find that they've left behind?"

Armed with her laptop, Val√©rie navigated the labyrinthine logs of her software. The hacker had disguised their moves meticulously, but a sliver of evidence gleamed‚Äîa distinctive encryption pattern that Jean-Pierre had championed in professional talks. It was circumstantial but pointed.

Sophie contacted her sources. Jean-Pierre had a solid alibi‚Äîhe'd been hosting a webinar during the time of the original hack. However, upon deeper probing, Sophie uncovered something fascinating. Jean-Pierre had recently acquired software capable of initiating a delayed, remote hack. He could set up the intrusion ahead of time and have an alibi for when it occurred.

Confronted with this evidence, Jean-Pierre's resistance shattered. Financial desperation had led him into the murky waters of sabotage. Though he tried to justify his actions, the weight of ethical betrayal was inescapable.

As they parted ways after the case, Sophie reflected, "Every technology is a Pandora's Box, isn't it? Filled with wonders and horrors alike."

Val√©rie agreed, solemnly. "Yes, but the key is recognizing which is which and acting accordingly."

Sophie drove back to her precinct, and Val√©rie to her fortress of dreams, both forever bound by the curious adventure that had led them through the veils separating right and wrong, reality and virtuality.
